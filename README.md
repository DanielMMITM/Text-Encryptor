# Text-Encryptor üîê

The idea of this project is to encrypt and decrypt your text. There are only 2 encryption algorithms at the moment.

We bring to the user an interactive console component so it gives a real console experience. The user must follow some rules (flags) to encrypt and decrypt a text, otherwise it won¬¥t work.

## Key Transposed Matrix

Here is the usage of the algorithm:

### Encrypt a text

- Use **_-t_** followed by the text to encrypt.
- Use **_-a_** followed by the algorithm to use (Clave).
- Use **_-rn_** followed by the number of rows to encrypt your text (3 / 4 / 5).
- Use **_-k_** followed by the secret key to encrypt your text.

### Decrypt a text

- To decrypt a text, write all the previous flags replacing the text with the given encrypted text and add **_-d_** at the end

## Columns Transposed Matrix

Here is the usage of the algorithm:

### Encrypt a text

- Use **_-t_** followed by the text to encrypt.
- Use **_-a_** followed by the algorithm to use (Clave).
- Use **_-rn_** followed by the number of rows to encrypt your text (3 / 4 / 5).
- Use **_-k_** followed by the secret key to encrypt your text.

### Decrypt a text

- Replace **_-rn_** with **_-cn_** followed by the number of columns given.
- Replace the text with the given encrypted text.
- Write all the previous flags and add **_-d_** at the end of the sentence.
